# UltimateUndercut
Intelligently undercuts your retainer listings!  
Skips the “1 gil troll” and ignores unrealistic highs, using recent market and sales data to pick a sane top-of-list price.  

### Requirements
Something Need Doing (SND) - https://github.com/Jaksuhn/SomethingNeedDoing

### Installation  
Use this URL when importing into SND to enable auto-updates:  
`https://github.com/StackBLU/UltimateUndercut/blob/main/UltimateUndercut.lua`

### Usage  
Just run it while your retainer list is open. The script will handle the rest.  
It currently does not check for AutoRetainer, so make sure that's not happening while you run this.

### Future Updates
Will add a price cut-off, so if something would sell for under X amount of gil, it'll just return the item to your inventory (optional).
